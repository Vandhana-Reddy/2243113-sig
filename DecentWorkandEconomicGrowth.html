        <h1>Goal 8: Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all</h1>
        <img src="pictures/SDG Icons 2019_WEB - Copy/English SDG icons/E-WEB-Goal-08.png" width="200" height="200" border="0" alt="Decent Work and Economic Growth" />

            <h2>General Description:</h2>
            <p>Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 has disrupted billions of lives and endangered the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects a global recession as bad as or worse than in 2009. As job losses escalate, the International Labor Organization estimates that nearly half of the global workforce is at risk of losing their livelihoods.</p>
            <p>Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, one in five countries – home to billions of people living in poverty – were likely to see per capita incomes stagnate or decline in 2020. Now, the economic and financial shocks associated with COVID-19—such as disruptions to industrial production, falling commodity prices, financial market volatility, and rising insecurity—are derailing the already tepid economic growth and compounding heightened risks from other factors.</p>
