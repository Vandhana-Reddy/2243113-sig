        <h1>Goal 17: Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development</h1>
        <img src="pictures/SDG Icons 2019_WEB - Copy/English SDG icons/E-WEB-Goal-17.png" width="200" height="200" border="0" alt="Partnerships For The Goals" />

            <h2>General Description:</h2>
            <p>The SDGs can only be realized with strong global partnerships and cooperation.</p>
            <p>A successful development agenda requires inclusive partnerships — at the global, regional, national and local levels — built upon principles and values, and upon a shared vision and shared goals placing people and the planet at the centre.</p>
            <p>Many countries require Official Development Assistance to encourage growth and trade. Yet, aid levels are falling and donor countries have not lived up to their pledge to ramp up development finance.</p>
            <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply, by 3 per cent, in 2020, experiencing its worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>
            <p>Strong international cooperation is needed now more than ever to ensure that countries have the means to recover from the pandemic, build back better and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
